#### Article 1 - Notarial profession
Notarial service is a public service.  
Notaries authenticate documents to ensure legal security and prevent disputes.  
Notaries perform other duties assigned to them by laws.
#### Article 2 - Establishment of notary offices and their jurisdiction
A notary office shall be established in each location of a district or separate civil court, authorized to perform notarial acts within the judicial district of that court.  
However, if the jurisdiction of a district court covers multiple districts, notary offices may also be established in other districts when necessary.  
Furthermore, if there is more than 1 notary office within the municipal boundaries of a province, each notary office is authorized to perform all notarial acts within the municipal boundaries of the province, regardless of the judicial district of the district court to which it belongs.  
In districts where district courts have been abolished, 1st, 2nd and 3rd class notary offices continue their activities.  
Additional notary offices may also be established in these locations.  
Article 109 does not apply to notary offices that continue operations or are newly established in districts without district courts, being within the same judicial district but outside the same municipal boundaries.  
The provisions of Part 10 are reserved.
#### Article 3 - Opening multiple notary offices and closing notary offices
The Ministry of Justice may open multiple notary offices in locations with increased workload.  
The Ministry of Justice exercises the authority specified in the previous paragraph taking into account the total gross income of notary offices in a given location and trends in business activity development.  
It may close more than 1 of the existing notary offices, provided they are vacant.  
Before exercising its authority to open multiple notary offices and close more than 1 notary office, the Ministry of Justice shall seek the opinion of the Union of Notaries of Turkey.  
1st, 2nd and 3rd class notary offices in districts where district courts have been abolished may be closed by the Ministry of Justice upon proposal of the Union of Notaries of Turkey if they are vacant.
#### Article 4 - Classification of notary offices
Notary offices are divided into four classes.  
First, second and third class notary offices are classified by the Ministry of Justice after obtaining the opinion of the Union of Notaries of Turkey.  
This classification is based on the population within the jurisdiction of each notary office, workload and notary income.  
Generally, notary offices attached to the same court are considered to be of the same class.  
The Ministry of Justice examines the status of notary offices every four years and publishes the new classification in the Official Gazette.  
New notary offices opened during the four-year period specified in the previous paragraph are classified without waiting for the end of this period according to the second paragraph and taking into account their estimated gross income, which is announced in the Official Gazette.  
The provision of Article 31 regarding downgrading to fourth class remains reserved.  
However, notary offices to be transferred from fourth class to third class are determined and announced at the beginning of April each year.  
Until the new classification is announced, the previous classification applies.

For persons first entering service through appointment as a 3rd class notary, the 3rd class service begins from the date of their assuming office.  
The minimum length of service for a notary in the 2nd and 3rd class is 4 years for each class.  
At the end of this period, advancement in class is possible provided that the latest service record prepared by the justice inspector contains a positive opinion regarding them.  
Upgrading the class of a notary office does not affect the class of the notary.  
If a notary serving in an upgraded notary office has not completed their service period in the previous class, they begin service in the higher class from the date this period is completed; however, if their latest service record prepared by the justice inspector before this date indicates inability for class advancement, they begin service in the higher class at the same notary office from the date of preparation of the next first service record containing a positive opinion.
