## Part 1 - General provisions
#### Article 1 - Notarial profession
Notarial service is a public service.  
Notaries authenticate documents to ensure legal security and prevent disputes.  
Notaries perform other duties assigned to them by laws.
#### Article 2 - Establishment of notary offices and their jurisdiction
A notary office shall be established in each location of a district or separate civil court, authorized to perform notarial acts within the judicial district of that court.  
However, if the jurisdiction of a district court covers multiple districts, notary offices may also be established in other districts when necessary.  
Furthermore, if there is more than one notary office within the municipal boundaries of a province, each notary office is authorized to perform all notarial acts within the municipal boundaries of the province, regardless of the judicial district of the district court to which it belongs.  
In districts where district courts have been abolished, first, second and third class notary offices continue their activities.  
Additional notary offices may also be established in these locations.  
Article 109 does not apply to notary offices that continue operations or are newly established in districts without district courts, being within the same judicial district but outside the same municipal boundaries.  
The provisions of Part 10 are reserved.
#### Article 3 - Opening multiple notary offices and closing notary offices
The Ministry of Justice may open multiple notary offices in locations with increased workload.  
The Ministry of Justice exercises the authority specified in the previous paragraph taking into account the total gross income of notary offices in a given location and trends in business activity development.  
It may close more than one of the existing notary offices, provided they are vacant.  
Before exercising its authority to open multiple notary offices and close more than one notary office, the Ministry of Justice shall seek the opinion of the Union of Notaries of Turkey.  
First, second and third class notary offices in districts where district courts have been abolished may be closed by the Ministry of Justice upon proposal of the Union of Notaries of Turkey if they are vacant.
